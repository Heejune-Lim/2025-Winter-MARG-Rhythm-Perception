This is the PsychoPy code for the pilot experiment I conducted for my research internship in MARG. 

Subjects of the test first performed two pretests:

i) the M-BAT test developed by the Brain, Music and Sound Research group by the University of Montreal

ii) the Tone-Deafness Test developed by Dr. Samuel Mehr of Yale University

In the actual experiment, subjects were instructed to tap on the SPACE bar on the STRONGER beats (i.e. count the music as 1, 2, 3, 4 then press it on the 1s and 3s), while hearing a series of sine tones and/or metronome clicks that are in 4/4 i.e. consisted of four beats per bar. After practicing from two straightforward examples ("Mary had a Little Lamb" and "Auld Lang Syne"), the subjects performed the task on two stimuli; one (0.wav) consisting solely of three consecutive metronome clicks on the beat (repeated every bar), while the other(randomly selected from 1.wav to 7.wav) consisting solely of two sine waves forming a rising fourth (repeated every bar), starting from any of the seven white-keyed pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, B. 

Subjects then performed the task on 28 additional stimuli; 21(8.wav to 28.wav) consist of the metronome clicks aligned with the sine waves, with the clicks shifted by the beat in three different ways (the first sine wave always aligned with a metronome click). 7(29.wav to 35.wav) consist of popular melodies in seven different keys aligned with metronome clicks, in order to check the focus of the subjects. Between two consecutive stimuli (including the practice sessions), a short outburst of white noise was presented. 

Since the stimuli were in 120 beats per minute, the recorded space bar taps were expected to be placed in intervals of one second(unless the subject changed their perception mid-stimuli - such cases were exceptional in the pilot and the responses were almost always consistent); the point of interest was whether the taps were aligned on the first of the two sine waves (the space bar taps would form around 0 modulo 1), or the second (0.5 modulo 1). The goal of the experiment was to investigate the reasons whether and why one interpretation would be preferred to the other.
